# ðŸ§® System Health Analyzer

This script reads the system health logs generated by the main **System Health Logger** project and summarizes key performance statistics like **average CPU**, **memory**, and **disk usage**.  
It gives a quick snapshot of how the system has been performing over time.



## What It Does
- Reads the `health_log.txt` file created by the logger.
- Calculates:
  - Average and peak CPU usage
  - Average memory usage
  - Peak disk usage
- Displays an easy-to-read system health summary.




## How It Works
The script parses each line of the log (which looks like this):
```

2025-10-08 12:45:23, CPU=45, MEM=62, DISK=70

````
and computes statistics using **pandas**.



## How to Run

1. Navigate to your project folder:
   ```bash
   cd system-health-logger
    ````

2. Install dependencies (only the first time):

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```
3. Run the analyzer:

   ```bash
   python3 analyzer.py
   ```
4. Youâ€™ll see output like:

   ```
   ===== SYSTEM HEALTH SUMMARY =====
   Average CPU Usage  : 45.32%
   Peak CPU Usage     : 93.00%
   Average Memory Use : 62.14%
   Peak Disk Usage    : 78.00%
   ```
