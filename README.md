🚀 How to Run

Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/system-health-logger.git
cd system-health-logger

Step 2: Give Execution Permission

chmod +x monitor.sh cleanup.sh

Step 3: Run the Script

./monitor.sh

Step 4: Setup Cron Job (for automation)

crontab -e
*/10 * * * * /home/$USER/system-health-logger/monitor.sh

This will execute the monitoring script every 10 minutes automatically.
