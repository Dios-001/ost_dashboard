# Smart System Monitor

> An end-to-end automation framework to monitor, visualize, and alert on system performance — built using **Shell**, **Python**, and **Cron Jobs**.

## Overview

This project continuously tracks **CPU**, **Memory**, and **Disk usage**, automatically logs metrics, sends **real-time alerts**, and visualizes performance trends.  
It demonstrates proficiency in:
- Shell automation  
- Python scripting  
- System monitoring and analytics  
- GitHub-based collaboration  

## Architecture

```
+-------------------+
|   monitor.sh      |  →  Orchestrates execution and scheduling
+-------------------+
|   logger.py       |  →  Collects and logs CPU, memory, and disk metrics
|   alert.py        |  →  Sends alerts when usage exceeds threshold
|   analyzer.py     |  →  Summarizes health data and generates reports
|   visualize.py    |  →  Plots performance trends using Matplotlib
+-------------------+
|   config.json     |  →  Thresholds, email settings, file paths
+-------------------+
```

## Tech Stack

| Category | Tools / Libraries |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Languages** | Python, Bash |
| **Libraries** | `psutil`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `smtplib` |
| **Automation** | Cron (Linux) |
| **Collaboration** | GitHub (branches, PRs, issue tracking) |
| **Platform** | Ubuntu / Linux |

## Folder Layout

```
system-health-logger/
├── monitor.sh
├── logger.py
├── alert.py
├── analyzer.py
├── visualize.py

└── README.md
```

## Key Features

- **Automated Logging:** Continuously records CPU, memory, and disk usage.  
- **Email Alerts (optional):** Sends notifications when CPU crosses defined thresholds.  
- **Visualization:** Displays resource usage trends via `matplotlib` graphs (CPU, Memory, Disk).  
- **Performance Summary:** Analyzer script computes averages, peaks, health verdict, and exports to text file.  
- **Cron Automation:** Executes scripts automatically at regular intervals.  
- **Collaborative GitHub Workflow:** Demonstrates version control, issues, and pull requests.  

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dios-001/smart-system-monitor.git
cd smart-system-monitor
```

### 2. Configure Settings
```json
{
  "log_file": "logs/health_log.txt",
  "cpu_limit": 80,
  "email_user": "sender@gmail.com",
  "email_pass": "app_password",
  "email_to": "receiver@gmail.com"
}
```

### 3. Run Locally
```bash
chmod +x monitor.sh
./monitor.sh
```

### 4. Schedule with Cron
Set up automatic monitoring every 10 minutes:
```bash
crontab -e
*/10 * * * * /home/$USER/system-health-logger/monitor.sh
```

## Script Responsibilities

| Script | Function |
|--------|-----------|
| **monitor.sh** | Master script that triggers Python modules in sequence |
| **logger.py** | Gathers CPU, memory, and disk stats using `psutil` |
| **alert.py** | Checks thresholds and sends mail via `smtplib` |
| **analyzer.py** | Calculates averages, peaks, health verdict, and exports report |
| **visualize.py** | Generates `usage_plot.png` graph showing system usage trends |

## Sample Outputs

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **logs/health_log.txt** | Generated by `logger.py` each cycle. Contains timestamped raw readings of CPU, memory, and disk usage. |
| **logs/summary.txt** | Created by `analyzer.py`. Shows average and peak usage statistics with system health verdict and timestamp. |
| **logs/usage_plot.png** | Produced by `visualize.py`. A line graph visualizing CPU, memory, and disk performance trends. |

## Git Workflow & Collaboration

Each contributor maintained a personal branch, committed descriptive changes, and raised pull requests for peer review.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/logger
git add logger.py
git commit -m "Add system logging module"
git push origin feature/logger
```

Pull requests were merged after review using GitHub’s issue-tracking and version control features.
